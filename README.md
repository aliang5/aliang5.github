# Annie Liang's Data Portfolio

My name is Annie Liang. I have just graduated with a Master’s degree in Computational Statistics from California State University, East Bay at Hayward,CA in June. Currently I am seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst/Data Scientist. 

I have a solid background in data analysis. With a deep understanding in statistical theories, I have also completed several data analysis projects applying statistical methods in **R** and **Python** with large datasets. These projects involve several parts of data analysis such as large data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, regression (machine learning), data mining, data visualization and data manipulation with **SQL**. 

## MORE ABOUT ME
For statistical analysis projects conducted in **R**, I’ve created scatterplots, boxplots and correlation matrix heatmap in R, and also hypothesis testing and other exploratory analysis. I've also conducted analysis applying supervised methods (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression) on Amazon reviews, bank loans and sapce shuttle dataset.

In **Python**, I’ve completed a project of 20 movie genres classification on IMDb Movie. I have used Naïve Bayes,and Logistic Regression classifiers and applied Bag-of-Words model and TF-IDF methods for feature extraction, and reduced test error to 0.017 using Logistic Regression and  and TF-IDF. I’ve also completed Keras project on hands gesture recongition, which ranked as one of the best course project in class.

For other **data visualization project** in [**Tableau**](https://public.tableau.com/profile/annie.liang8543), I’ve cleaned data of 109 policy markers surveys on women and girl issues, and presented dashboard of the important issues. I have also creatted interactive map on Airbnb listing's pricing at LA cities .


## SKILLS

## PROJECTS

- [Python Hands Gesture Recognition](https://github.com/aliang5/aliang5.github/tree/master/Projects/Hands-Recognition)<br />Mar. 2018
  
  Applied Convolution Neural Network on hand gesture images with various backgrounds. ReLu activation function was used. SGD adjusted over time using built in Keras LearningRateSchedule function. Model accuracy was 73.8%.

- [IMDb Movies Genres Classification](https://github.com/aliang5/aliang5.github/tree/master/Projects/IMDB_movies)<br />Mar. 2018

  Used Multinomial Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression classifiers to conduct movie genres classification on IMDb English movies from 1960 to 2018 in Python. Applied Bag-of-Words model and TF-IDF methods for feature extraction. Reduced test error to 0.017 using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF. 

  
- [ Kaggle Fine Food Product Reviews Classification](https://github.com/aliang5/aliang5.github/tree/master/Projects/Amazon_food_reviews)<br />Feb. 2018

  Used Naïve Bayes to conduct positive/negative sentiment classification on food prodct reviews from Amazon that span a period of 10 years. Applied Bag-of-Word model method. Improved model using Laplace estimator.


- [Text Analytic on Climate Change Tweets](https://github.com/aliang5/aliang5.github/tree/master/Projects/Tweets)<br />Jan. 2018

  Collected hashtaged climate change tweets using Twitter API. Lexicon used for sentiment scores. Created network visualizations in R to find clusters of most connected frequently used word. Much more negative opinions expressed in the tweets than positive opinions. 


- [Epicurious (Recipes with Rating and Nutrition) Data Analysis And Visualization](https://github.com/aliang5/aliang5.github/tree/master/Projects/Epicurious)<br />June 2017
  
  Crafted exploratory analysis and data visualizations to understand healthy level of meals listed in the site. Discovered positive correlation between carlories and common nutritional factors such as fat and protein. Found top 25 mentioned ingredients. Higher average carlories found with Good and Ok rated recipes.


- [NASA Risk Analysis of Space Shuttle](https://github.com/aliang5/aliang5.github/tree/master/Projects/Space_NASA)<br /> Mar. 2017

  Predicted distress count for space shuttle launch data using Logistic Regression in R. Resampled data using bootstrap method. Compared fit of model using Likelihood Ratio/Wald test and found temperature as endogeneity.


- [Regression Analysis on Diamond Price](https://github.com/aliang5/aliang5.github/tree/master/Projects/Diamond_Price)<br /> Feb. 2017
  
  Fitted multivariate linear regression models on diamond price against the four C's based on  advertisement data found on AMSTAT. Applied Box-cox data transformation on non-normally distributed data. Conducted outlier test, Breusch-Pagan test and Shapiro Wilk test in R to test for model assumptions. Used AIC for model selection. Characteristics that drive high diamond price were carat and color.


- [Identifying Risky Bank Loans: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classification](https://github.com/aliang5/aliang5.github/tree/master/Projects/Bank_Loan)<br /> Feb. 2017

   Achieved 72 percent accuracy using Logistic Regression on 17 features including checking balance, credit history, months loan duration and etc. Improved 2% accuracy using AIC feature selections. Improved 10% accuracy using Decision Tree model and adaptive bossting.


## OTHER EXPERIENCES
- **Volunteer**, Data For Democracy<br />Mar. 2018 – Present
  
  Conducted data manipulation and analysis in SQL. Participated for the proposal of Twitter Health Metric (https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/twitter-health-metrics-proposal-submission.html)
