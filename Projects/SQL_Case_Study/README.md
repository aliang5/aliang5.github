# Analysis of Users Engagement Drop

This repo contains the report and SQL queries that describes analysis done to understand the reasons behind the drop in Yammer's user activity during July- August 2014.

The Solutions:
The following hypothesis are checked to find out possible reasons leading to the engagement dip:

1.	Users Activity by Country: The trend will indicate if there are holidays, summer vocations and/or Internet connectivity issues that have caused the problem.
2.	User Activity by Month: The trend will show if there is sudden influx of new users enrollment due to an marketing event and users are not using the account after signing up
3.	User Activity by Device or Device Type: The trend will indicate if the engagement dip is related to devices like computers, phones or tablets
4.	User Activity by Activity Type: The trend will indicate if the engagement dip is related to specific activity

Conclusion:
- Email clickthroughs are down since the end of July but number of user opening email is still up. This suggests an issue in the email that being sent. Even though users were opening the email but with the invalid email link, it failed to direct users to Yammer platform.
- The email issue is greater in mobile and tablet users that suggest an issue with the app

These findings should be discussed with PM for validation and remedy actions. In addition, more work needs to be done in investigating the emails that have gone out since 28-Jul and talking to PM to find out what recent changes were made to the app
